# docker-ansible-role-tester
A workspace to demonstrate building docker images from arbitrary roles.

This is based off [Chris Meyer's work](https://www.ansible.com/blog/testing-ansible-roles-with-docker) around testing ansible roles with docker.  Reworked to only include certain parts appropriate for my own personal use case.
